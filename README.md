This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Test

This is a technical challenge I did for a senior frontend developer position at [On The Go](https://www.onthego.com.br). 
I had to use the following stack as instructed:

```
- NextJS
- Material UI
- Axios
- React-hook-form
```

And I followed the predefined layout through [Figma] (https://www.figma.com)
